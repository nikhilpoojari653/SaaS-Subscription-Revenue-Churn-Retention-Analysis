The objective is to understand:
- How revenue grows over time  
- Where revenue leaks due to churn  
- Which customer segments and pricing tiers drive **sustainable growth**

## Business Objectives
- Track **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** and revenue trends  
- Analyze **customer churn** and **churned revenue**  
- Identify **primary revenue drivers** (New vs Expansion vs Churn)  
- Evaluate **pricing tier performance** and upsell behavior  
- Measure **revenue retention** using cohort analysis  


## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Dashboarding & visualization  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning & transformation  
- **DAX** – KPI calculations (MRR, ARPU, churn, expansion)  


## Key Metrics Analyzed
- Total MRR  
- Active Customers  
- ARPU  
- New, Expansion & Churned MRR  
- Revenue Churn  
- Cohort-Based Revenue Retention  

## Dashboard Structure

### 1️. Executive Overview
- Total MRR, Active Customers, ARPU, Churned MRR  
- Monthly MRR trend  
- Revenue movement breakdown (New vs Expansion vs Churn)  

### 2️. Churn Analysis
- Monthly churned MRR trend  
- Churned revenue by pricing tier  
- Churn segmentation by company size  

### 3️. Cohort Analysis
- Revenue retention heatmap by signup cohort  
- Month-over-month revenue decay analysis  

### 4️. Pricing Tier Analysis
- MRR contribution by pricing tier  
- Expansion revenue by plan  
- ARPU comparison across tiers  

## Key Insights
- Expansion revenue becomes a **major growth driver** in later months, reducing reliance on new acquisition  
- Lower pricing tiers show **higher churn**, while **Pro plans demonstrate stronger expansion behavior**  
- Revenue retention declines gradually over time, though **recent cohorts perform better**  
- A **small group of high-tier customers contributes a disproportionate share of total revenue**  

## Business Impact
- Distinguishes **healthy growth vs churn-masked growth**  
- Identifies pricing tiers with **high churn risk**  
- Enables **cohort-driven retention strategies**  
- Supports **data-driven pricing and upsell decisions**
